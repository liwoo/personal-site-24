### üöÄ Let's Get Started 

For this site I decided to go with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and forked the [AstroWind](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) template to customize it with this design I came up with!

Basically, I was optimizing for:

- **üí® Exceptional Performance** - Achieving top scores in PageSpeed Insights for blazing-fast loading times.
- **üåì Elegant Design** - Integrated with Tailwind CSS for a sleek appearance, featuring a seamless Dark mode.
- **üìä Analytics-Driven** - Enhanced with Google Analytics and Splitbee for insightful user engagement data.
- **üìù Engaging Blog** - A platform to share insights on .NET, Flutter, React, and the latest Software Engineering.
