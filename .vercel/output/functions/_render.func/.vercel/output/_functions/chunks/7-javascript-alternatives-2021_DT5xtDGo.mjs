Previously the only practical way to build for the Web was to use Javascript: the language with a built-in interpreter in every web browser.  This works perfectly well if you are willing to be constrained to the API exposed by Javascript and HTML to manipulate the DOM.  Some applications, however, require more fine-grained control of the lowest building blocks of the browser.  Things like memory management and concurrency are tricks that developers of highly performant platforms like video games reach to squeeze the juices out of the hardware they are running on.</p>\n<p>With WASM, this immediately becomes possible.  In fact, companies like Figma are using WASM to build experiences on the Web that were only previously possible on the native desktop.  AutoCAD, Figma, and Blazor (explained below) are just examples of projects that are taking advantage of this new browser standard.  What’s more, WASM can be generated from highly performant languages such as C, C++, Rust, and Go.</p>\n<p><strong>🚀 Good for</strong>: Use WASM if you need to manipulate the lowest level possible of your hardware.  Things like compression, video streaming, and other such CPU-intensive tasks that you want to perform on the browser are great candidates for using WASM.</p>\n<p><strong>🛑 Not Good for</strong>:  You could build your portfolio website with Rust and WASM, and it will work just fine, but it will make no difference to your visitors whether you used WASM or built it with React.

The Client edition runs as a separate App that compiles into WASM to run directly in the browser, communicating with the server through a web API.  But it’s the Server version I’m more concerned with here. Blazor Server ships HTML over the wire on every web request (such as clicking the Save button in a form) through .NET real-time web communication protocol called SignalR.</p>\n<p>Apart from building your front-end completely in C# (and an XML-like DSL), the biggest advantage of Blazor Server is that all your application state lives completely on the server-side.  This gives you complete control of such things as Database access and third-party APIs such as the ones you would need for sending email or SMSs, without trying to implement such complexity in the client’s browser, or worse yet, duplicating it.</p>\n<p><strong>🚀 Good for</strong>: Applications that will be used in a controlled environment, such as the office LAN, since SignalR connections can be especially resource-intensive.</p>\n<p><strong>🛑 Not Good for</strong>: Applications that will have a LOT of concurrent users, such as Twitter.

This resulted in a trend in which Laravel et al were used solely as backends that talked to the Database and other 3rd party APIs, exposing a Web API for a rich Javascript Frontend written in Vue.  The trouble with this becomes: why should I have to create two separate projects when it’s really just one web application?</p>\n<p>That’s where <a href=\"https://laravel-livewire.com\">Livewire</a> comes in.  By embracing the tight coupling of View, Controller, and Model (it is called MVC for a reason!), Livewire allows you to write your front-end in the same server-generated blade templates you would have been used to.  The magic is that, in real-time, requests to the server will generate some changes to the originally rendered HTML, and ship only the difference to the browser asynchronously, and Livewire will automagically glue the new pieces off HTML together as they come in!</p>\n<p><strong>🚀 Good for</strong>: For both Admin-facing and public-facing applications, Livewire, Hotwire, and Liveview are excellent choices.
