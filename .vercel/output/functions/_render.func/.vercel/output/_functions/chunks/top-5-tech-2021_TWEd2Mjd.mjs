GraphQL</h3>\n<h4 id=\"difficulty\">Difficulty: 🟢</h4>\n<p>Created in 2015, <a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> is a new way to transport and consume data between servers and clients.  Facebook designed the GraphQL specification specifically for low bandwidth conditions to solve two main problems in the REST specification we use today: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44564905/what-is-over-fetching-or-under-fetching\">over fetching and under fetching data</a>.  If you are reading this article, you probably live in a country where most of the users you are building apps for face the problem of unstable internet and low bandwidth.

Since the API is strongly-typed from the server-side, tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground\">GraphQL Playground</a> (my favorite), <a href=\"https://github.com/graphql/graphiql\">GraphiQL</a> or <a href=\"https://insomnia.rest\">Insomnia</a> can provide autocompletion and accurate documentation of the API you will be consuming without needing to call the backend guy!

The topic itself is quite broad and may require brushing up on relevant mathematics to master.  However, several Frameworks exist to ensure that you don’t wander too far down this path, with most of them written in either Python or R programming language.  If JavaScript is the Web Browser language, Python has undoubtedly emerged as the language for Data Science and Machine Learning. <a href=\"https://pytorch.org\">PyTorch</a>, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">Scikit Learn</a>, and <a href=\"https://keras.io\">Keras</a> are some excellent ML choices, but by far, the most popular Framework available today is <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org\">Google’s TensorFlow</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQF8QagRziNBVQ/article-cover_image-shrink_423_752/0/1583890575960?e=1714608000&#x26;v=beta&#x26;t=mvIqw-CD91kvO2RvdT9zh7ZuElUEpJ70ws2iYf8uLxg\" alt=\"Machine Learning Everywhere\"></p>\n<p>At its core, TensorFlow provides some useful abstractions over the somewhat complicated underlying principles and algorithms for doing ML. It certainly does not replace the need to understand these principles, but it does provide an intuitive API that you can interact with, allowing you to build pretty much any ML solution you can think of.  For mere developers like me, one book I strongly recommend to equip you just enough to be dangerous is called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291\">“Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems.”</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"3-flutter\">3.
