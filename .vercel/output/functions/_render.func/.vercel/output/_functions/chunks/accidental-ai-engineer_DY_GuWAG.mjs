Another curious soul wanders in, seemingly puzzled as to what I'm working on. And just as I begin forming an explanation, I pause, realizing how different my answer is going to be today compared to just a few months ago.\n\n> The journey that brought me here is a testament to how rapidly our field evolves – and how the most meaningful careers often emerge from unexpected turns.\n\n## Rediscovering AI's Soul\n\nBut what _is_ an AI Engineer, really? Not long ago, I would have launched into a well-rehearsed spiel about [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning), [deep nueral networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deep-neural-network), and data science in general. These were the technologies that seemed to define AI for the [past decade](https://thenextweb.com/news/2010-2019-the-rise-of-deep-learning). But as I peered closer into its origin, I discovered something fascinating: AI's [true essence](https://www.adservio.fr/post/what-are-the-components-of-ai) extends far beyond prediction and inference.\n\nWhile the last decade spotlighted the mathematical brilliance of machine learning, it somewhat overshadowed AI's other vital dimensions: the [deep domain knowledge of expert systems](https://www.javatpoint.com/knowledge-representation-in-ai), the nuanced decision-making of [autonomous agents](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/woodridge_intelligent_agents.pdf), and most importantly, the art of [natural human interaction](https://www.expert.ai/blog/natural-language-understanding-different-nlp/).\n\n![Evolution of Artifical Intelligence](https://cdn.infodiagram.com/c/67a62b/ai-development-timeline.png)\nCredit: infoDiagram\n\nWhen [ChatGPT was announced](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) just over 2 years ago, suddenly the sci-fi dreams that first drew many of us to technology seemed within reach: computers that could truly converse, understand context, and perhaps even [fall in love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/) :) Not only would AI make its much anticipated grand entrance onto the mainstream, so would new specializations for working with the models that powered it. Specializations like the AI Engineer.\n\n> And so today, I'm quick to make the marked distinction between AI Engineering (that is applying AI to Software Engineering) and ML Engineering or Research Engineering - the latter two being more focused on the development and deployment of machine learning models.\n\n## The Unexpected Detour That Changed Everything\n\nMy journey into AI actually started way back in 2014, though I didn't know it at the time. Imagine me, a fresh IT graduate from [Poly](https://www.mubas.ac.mw/), having just landed my dream job as a software engineer at a top Bank. Then, boom, I receive an email saying the MEng scholarship I applied for has been awarded 🎉.\n\n> The only problem: I don't know what to specialize in! \"Why not explore NLP for Chewa?\" [Edmond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edmond-kachale/) asks, referring to our native language [spoken across Malawi and Zambia](https://translateswift.com/languages/chichewa/).\n\nWhat I didn't know then is that my mentor wasn't simply referring to an academic pursuit. He was hinting towards the [preservation of an entire culture](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/digital-future-indigenous-languages-insights-partnerships-forum).\n\n> Languages like mine, by virtue of being under-resourced, face digital extinction in this increasingly connected world.\n\nArmed with more enthusiasm than expertise, I dove into the challenge of creating a text-to-speech system for Chewa.\n\n![My attempt at building a Chewa IPA](https://minio-api.dartsmw.com/chienda.com/chewa-ipa.jpg)\n\nLooking back, I smile at our \"rudimentary\" approach – statistical models and hidden Markov chains that seemed cutting-edge at the time. Working with limited computing power (at that time) and an almost non-existent corpus, I spent countless hours recording speech samples, creating transcriptions, and wrestling with the fundamental challenge of encoding a language that didn't even have a standardized phonetic alphabet.\n\n<GoogleTrends client:load />\n\n## From Language to Legacy\n\nThe path from that initial research to my current role wasn't linear. Each position I held – from the [Ministry of Health's digital initiatives](health-interoperability-in-malawi) to serving one million farmers at One Acre Fund – added another piece to the puzzle. But it was an intriguing job posting at Irembo that finally brought everything into focus.\n\nIrembo's pitch was audacious: to leverage AI and voice technology to serve Rwanda's 14+ million citizens, many of whom live in areas where smartphones and internet access are luxuries. They weren't just building another chatbot – they were reimagining how technology could serve people on their own terms, through their own languages.\n\n## Crafting Tomorrow's Technology with Yesterday's Wisdom\n\nToday, as I lead AI initiatives at Irembo, we're building something that goes beyond traditional eGovernment Platforms. [We're creating systems that can converse fluently in Kinyarwanda](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mphilbert_govtech-digitaltransformation-rwanda-activity-7257463052625723392-UKNB?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios), handle complex service requests autonomously, and bridge the digital divide through simple voice calls.\n\nWhat excites me most is how we're merging cutting-edge technology with Africa's rich oral traditions. In many ways, we're returning to AI's original promise: technology that adapts to humans, not the other way around. We're proving that the future of technology doesn't have to mean abandoning cultural heritage – instead, it can help preserve and amplify it.\n\n![Irembo Agents serving Citizens using IremboAI](https://minio-api.dartsmw.com/chienda.com/irembo-agents.png)\n\nEvery morning, as I walk into our office in Kigali, I'm reminded that becoming an AI Engineer wasn't just about learning new technologies – it was about finding a way to serve my community through technology. In the end, that's what being an [AI Engineer in 2024](https://roadmap.sh/ai-engineer) means to me: using the power of artificial intelligence not just to predict or compute, but to preserve, protect, and empower.\n\n---\n\n_Want to dive deeper into this journey?
