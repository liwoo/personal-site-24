I had decided to focus on C# and the .NET ecosystem.\n\nAround the same time, I was working on my first startup called Tiyeni, which I was building using React Native.  My experience with React Native was undewhelming in 2017, although I realize the community has come a long way since then.  \n\nGranted, Xamarin was no unicorn either, so eventually I settled on Flutter as the Google team seemed to tackle most of the issues I was frusrated with while building cross-platform Apps.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nI am still a C# fanboy to date and have been keenly watching Microsoft's journey from Xamarin to Xamari.Forms, to now .NET MAUI.  I really want them to do well. \n\nAnd as much as I'm happy with Flutter, one of my goals this year is to master as few languages as possible as and become more specialized. Dart is an enjoyable language (so is Swift); but its versatility really sucks!.  \n\nSo recently, I decided to give MAUI another try, for the first time in 7 years!  Here's my take.\n\n## What Matters to the Bosses\nChoosing a cross-platform technology is not just a personal decision.  Usually, you'll be working in a company where such decisions can have long-lasting ramifications down the line.  And even if you're a freelancer, you'll have to think about continuity of your project if your client decides to maintain it themselves.\n\n### 1. Ecosystem Maturity\nThe first question your boss will ask is: who else is using it. As annoying as such thinking can be, its valid.  React Native, for instance, has an impressive showcase.  It's an easy sell.  Kotlin Multiplatform, on the other hand, is a different story.\n\nBut popularity isn't the only thing to think about here.  You have to consider how well your framework plays with 3rd party tools for analytics, crashlitics, deployment, acceptance testing, etc.\n\nFlutter clearly takes this round.  Being a Google baby, its seamless integration with Firebase will get you very far very quikly.  Other Google tools like AdSense and In-App Purschases make it a mature choice for production Apps compared to MAUI.\n\nOn top of that, the community has grown tremendously over the last few years, and Google themselves do a great job building and maintaining plugins, as well as curating high quality 3rd party plugins that will help you solve pretty much any challenge you will encounter.\n\n> Flutter 1 : 0 MAUI\n\n### 2. Hireability\nThe next question you will probably get is: how easy is it to hire a C# developer?  This one is a bit more tricky.  Even though Dart has been around for 10 years as a language, it really only came to prominence after the announcement of Flutter.  \n\nC#, on the other hand, is a very popular business solutions language that has been around for more than 20 years and is used by some of the most talented developers around.\n\nSo if its just a dog fight between C# and Dart, you are more likely to find higher quality C# developers more easily.  But if you're specifically looking at people with Xamarin/MAUI exeprience vs Flutter experience, my hunch tells me that its probably going to be more even. \n\nBut since we are data-driven people, lets see what the numbers say about this:\n\n\n### 3. Performance \n## What Matters to Me\n## Conclusion\n\n";
